      Clicking this control will open the trade panel. The trade panel lists all
      the pending and recently concluded trades.

    <p>
      Here you can review the status of your trades (pending, completed or
      cancelled) as well as update any pending trade by adding or removing items
      and essence. Please note that updating a trade offer will automatically
      cancel the acceptance of the trade for both players.

    <p>
      Trades can only be performed while both players stay in the same location.
      Moving away will automatically cancel any pending trade.
