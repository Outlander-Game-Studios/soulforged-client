    <p>
      Most items, structures, creatures and other entities in the game are only
      provided with a generic name.
    </p>
    <p>These generic names are indicated using a specific style:</p>
    <RichText value="{example1:0:Unnamed example}" nonInteractive />
    <p>
      You can click on a name like this and choose a name you want to use to
      associate with this entity. Once that's done the name will instead show up
      like this:
    </p>
    <RichText value="{example2:1:Named example}" nonInteractive />
    <p>You can rename any entity freely, as many times as you need.</p>
    <p>
      Each player can name every entity according to their own, personal
      preferences. You can also see the names that other players chose for each
      entity, including the number of players who chose that name.
