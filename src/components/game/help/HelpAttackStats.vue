      The Abilities section describes your the options you will have when
      fighting hostile creatures. Most of these abilities will include hit
      rating and damage bonus and will be based off of a specific skill.

      <em>Hit Rating</em> affects your chances of scoring a hit on an enemy.
      Every attack has a chance to miss, deal partial damage or deal maximum
      damage. The higher your <em>Hit Rating</em> the higher the chance you will
      deal maximum damage to a creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Maximum Damage</em> describes the maximum amount of damage you may
      deal to a creature, depending on how well your strikes connect.
