      Some of the game mechanics can only be effectively engaged by groups of
      players. Cooperation is also rewarded by granting additional in-game
      currency called <em>Essence</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Essence</em> is generated based on how much different players,
      including yourself, benefit from your contributions, be it tools,
      equipment, food and other actions. Each day you will get some
      <em>Essence</em> added to your pool based on your contributions. Helping
      multiple players will help you generate more <em>Essence</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Essence</em> can be used for trading or spent purchasing powers for
      your current character. It's important to note that every power you
      purchase increases the cost of all subsequent power purchases for that
      character.
