    <!--      Some of the game mechanics can only be effectively engaged by groups of-->
    <!--      players. Cooperation is also rewarded by granting additional in-game-->
    <!--      currency called <em>Essence</em>.-->
    <!--    </p>-->
    <p>
      <em>Essence</em> is generated based on how much different players,
      including yourself, benefit from your contributions. Any item you gather
      or make will be marked as something you contributed towards. And when
      those items are used for crafting, eaten, or used as a tool or a weapon -
      they are then considered to benefit the player that used it. Helping
      multiple players will help you generate more <em>Essence</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day your contributions are turned into <em>Pending Essence</em>, for
      you to collect.<br />
      If you don't collect it on the day it'll simply continue to accumulate for
      you to collect at a later time. There is no penalty for not collecting
      your <em>Pending Essence</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Essence</em> can be used for trading or spent purchasing powers for
      your current character. It's important to note that every power you
      purchase increases the cost of all subsequent power purchases for that
      character.
