      Clicking this control will open the chat panel. Chat allows you to
      exchange message with other players in your current location.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any message you write will be visible by other players that are in the
      same location, including players who arrive to the location later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every message is retained for 48 hours after which it's removed from the
      chat log.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there are new messages you have not yet read in the area you're
      currently in then an indicator will be shown over the chat button
      indicating the number of new, unread messages.
