      Character can and will inevitably die in this game, either from illnesses,
      accidents, monsters or old age. With every death there are a number of
      things that can be considered lost:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>All the effects, including purchased Essence powers</li>
      <li>Your statistics gains</li>
      <li>Your skill gains</li>
      <li>
        Your inventory and equipment will be dropped at the location where you
        died, or will be kept guarded by the monster that killed you
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      After a death you will then be free to create a new character. There are a
      number of progress items that will carry on to your next character:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You will initially retain ownership of all buildings that your previous
        character owned, including items stored inside them
      </li>
      <li>
        You will retain knowledge of all of the crafting and building recipes
        you unlocked
      </li>
      <li>You will retain all monster knowledge you've gathered so far</li>
      <li>
        You will keep your <em>Essence</em> balance as it was at the time of
        death of your previous character
      </li>
      <li>
        All the names that you assigned to objects or characters will be
        retained
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Please note that if you do not create a new character after dying, the
      buildings you own will eventually be marked as unclaimed. How long it
      takes depends on how much of the game you have explored, ranging from few
      hours to several months.
    </p>
    <p>
      Character death also means that the price increase for the number of
      powers you purchased is reset.
